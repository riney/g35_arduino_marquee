This was a 48 hour new years project Riney and I put together in order to
take a functioning display to a friend's house for a new years eve party.
All work, start to finish was completed in that time span.  The only
additions after the fact are renaming a few variables for clarity and
documentation of the code.

I had a ton of fun working on this project with Riney.  I learned a great
deal, and hope that in sharing this code others will have the same fun in
expanding on what we've done here.

Feel free to use this code in any and all endeavors; all I ask is that if
you lift code for reuse from here you post your own code for others to
benefit from as well.
